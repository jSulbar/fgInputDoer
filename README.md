# fgInputDoer (creative,i know)
This is just a small script i made because i bought GGACR to play it with a friend when it was on sale, but i can't be bothered to actually practice all the inputs each character has. So of course, i made an AutoHotkey script to do them for me, as any sane person would do. I think.

The script uses numpad move notation, so a simple Hadouken input bound to Q would be done like so: q::performInput("236.P").

For now, it has my keybindings hardcoded in so you'll have to edit the script with yours.
